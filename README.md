## Description:
A single-page resource that allows students to build a relationship with their vocabulary words. Over the course of their progress in learning their vocabulary words, students can build a word using a template. The template can be updated over the course of their understanding of the word, refer to the word for studying purposes, and remove the word when they are ready to move onto new words.

### Website: [once this is deployed, a url will be here]

#### List of Technologies Used:
1. html
2. css
3. Bootstrap
4. javascript
5. git/github
6. ajax
7. jquery
8. Google fonts
9. Handlebars
10. Heroku
11. Ruby on Rails
12. Postgresql

#### Planning:
My first step was building a simple wireframe to have a vision of the page before execution and building a user story to be aware of functions to create for the game to be operative and user-friendly.
Next was to create a resource using Rudy on Rails and Postgresql. Once tested thoroughly, the production went to the client side.
My resource for the project was a vocabulary word table. The table would have keys such as Word, Definition, Sounds_like, Synonyms, Antonyms, and Sentence. The use would be able to provide their input values for their words.
Here, was where user stories and wireframe really came into play and heavily relied on. These gave inspiration for psuedo-code and how someone was to interact with the website and how the website was to be responsive to the user.
I went down my list of functions to be operative for the user. Sign-up, sign-in, change password, and sign-out. These are basic functions of any site but it is important for a user to have their own database as well.
If a user, in this case student, comes to this website, what are they wanting/here to do. This site is for students to develop a relationship with words over the course of their learning experience with them. This site allows a user to create a word, update that word as their understanding of the word evolves, view the word and it's contents for studying purposes, and of course, delete the word as they move onto new words.


#### Challenges
This project brought a lot of challenges. I have yet to work on both sides of an application before, so building tables on the backside was challenging. Working with a Ruby on Rails, which is a nice was to build relationships between data, and testing functionalities for the front was a bit tedious. Although I knew what I was doing, I had to test and test, to ensure what I was doing was right.
For the front-end , I had challenges with handlebars and incorporating data into it's forms, but also building buttons to run functions out of the templates. This required a lot of trial and error, but also path following and drawing out where the paths lie. Moving from one functionality to another, I was able to build functions for creating a word, updating a word, deleting a word, and viewing all/one word. With minor stylings and tweaking this will be a useful resource.


#### Unsolved Problems:
Stylings, stylings, stylings!
A great feature for a future add-on, would be a teacher feature.
With a teacher feature, teachers could log in and see their student's work and possibly comment.
