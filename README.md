## Description:
A single-page resource that allows students to build a relationship with their vocabulary words. Over the course of their progress in learning their vocabulary words, students can build a word using a template. The template can be updated over the course of their understanding of the word, refer to the word for studying purposes, and remove the word when they are ready to move onto new words.

### Website: [https://northross.github.io/tic-tac-toe-ross/]

#### List of Technologies Used:
1. html
2. css
3. Bootstrap
4. javascript
5. git/github
6. ajax
7. jquery
8. Google fonts
9. Handlebars
10. Heroku

#### Planning:
The project has a few parts that tie together. My first step was building a simple wireframe to have a vision of the page before execution and building a user story to be aware of functions to create for the game to be operative and user-friendly.
Next was to create simple board to display using html and css and js. HTML and css worked together to give a structure. JS allowed to board to display results based on the game engine.
The game engine built in JS allows for proper space selection and winner calculations.
Once the board was functional, the user and game API connections were important to allow user to have credentials and record games and moves on the board.
Last, I was to finely tune the styling of the page.

#### Challenges
This project brought a new challenge, as it was the first time I had used Handlbars and successfully used Bootstrap. Both are helpful and powerful tools for mass production of items, like this project entails. Creating a resource and replicating is a time saver and extremely practical.
